# Team 10 Status Report 2

### This Week's Accomplishments
- We added a function that iterates through the response received from ebay,
  finds the highest and lowest prices (and the dates on which they occurred),
  and stores them in global variables. It also computes the average price and
  displays all three values on our HTML page.
